// WHAT is JSX?
/* 
  - Declarative syntax to **describe** what components **look like** and **how** they work
  - Components must **return** a block of JSX
  - Extension of JS that allows us to **embed JS, CSS and React components into HTML**
  - Each JSX element is **converted** to a React.createElement function call
  - We could use React **without JSX**

JSX IS DECLARATIVE
  (Review: 
  Imperative - "HOW to do things"
    - Manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing
    - Step-by-step DOM mutations until we reached the desired UI)

  DECLARATIVE - "WHAT we want"
    - Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data (props and state)
    - This happens without manipulating DOM elements
    - An **abstraction** away from DOM: **we never touch the DOM**
    - Instead, we think of the UI as a **reflection of the current data**

SEPARATION OF CONCERNS? YES
- one technology per file (traditional way)

  Evolution
  Rise of interactive SPAs -> JS is in charge of HTML -> Logic and UI are tightly coupled -> Why keep them separated? -> React Components + JSX

  Component
    - Data
    - Logic
    - Appearance

  ONE COMPONENT PER FILE
    Each component is concerned with one piece of the UI
    - Question
    - Menu
    - Filters
    - Player

PROPS {}
  - HOW we passed data BETWEEN components (from parent to child components)
  - a.k.a. communication channel
  - you can pass through any data (arrays, objects, numbers or etc)
  - FUNDAMENTAL things on the react

  PROPS ARE **READ-ONLY!**
  ‚òù Props are read-only, they are **immutable**! This is one of React's strict rules.
    
  ‚òù If you need to mutate props, you actually **need state**

    WHY?
      üëâ Mutating props would affect parent, creating **side effects** (not pure). React is pure functions.
      üëâ Components have to be **pure functions** in terms of props and state
      üëâ This allows React to optimize apps, avoid bugs, make apps predictable

  - Data
    - Props - data coming from the **outside**, and can **only** be updated by the **parent component**
    - State - internal data that can be update by the **component's logic**
  - Logic
  - Appearance

  ONE-WAY DATA FLOW
    - from parents to children (top to bottom) and never to opposite direction

    WHY?
    üëâ ...makes applications more predictable and easier to understand
    üëâ ...makes applications easier to debug, as we have more control over the data
    üëâ ...is more performant

RULES OF JSX RULES

  General JSX Rules

  üëâ JSX works essentially like HTML, but we can enter "Javascript mode" by using {} (for text or attributes)

  üëâ We can place JavaScript expressions inside {}. Examples: reference variables, create arrays or objects,[].map(), ternary operator

  üëâ Statements are **not allowed** (if/else, for, switch)

  üëâ JSX produces a JS expression
    const el = <h1>Hello React!</h1>
    const el = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello React!");
    1. We can place **other pieces of JSX** inside {}
    2. We can write JSX **anywhere** inside a component (in if/else, assign to variables, pass it into functions)

  üëâ A piece of JSX can only have **one root element**. If you need more, use <React.Fragment> (or the short <>)

RENDERING LISTS
  - we have an array and create ONE component for each element of the array. Instead of doing it manually, we want to do it all at once dynamically.

CONDITIONAL RENDERING
  üëâ **Ternary Operator** - use this when you need to return some piece of JSX based on a condition. We can use it ALL the time.

  üëâIF/ELSE - if we want something that is **nothing** (null)

EXTRACTING JSX INTO A NEW COMPONENT
  - We should use **props**

DESTRUCTURING PROPS
  - use curly braces "{}" 

REACT FRAGMENT "<></>"
  - lets us GROUP more than one elements (i.e. "<p></p>", "<ul></ul>") without leaving any trace in a HTML Tree (DOM)
